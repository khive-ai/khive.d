# Meta-Design: Using AI Tools to Design AI Tools

## The Self-Improving Loop

One of the most powerful insights from our design process is that **we should
use khive's own tooling to design and improve khive itself**. This creates a
virtuous cycle where improvements to the tool immediately benefit the
development of further improvements.

## Meta-Design Principles

### 1. **Dogfooding as Development**

Every feature we design for AI agents should be immediately used by AI agents
(us) to design the next feature.

### 2. **Iterative Self-Discovery**

The tool should be able to introspect and suggest improvements to itself.

### 3. **Feedback Loop Integration**

Each development session should contribute to a knowledge base that improves
future sessions.

## Practical Implementation

### Phase 1: Self-Documentation

```python
# src/khive/agent/self_improve.py

class SelfImprovementEngine:
    """Engine for khive to improve itself."""

    def analyze_usage_patterns(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Analyze how khive is being used to develop khive."""
        history = CommandHistory(PROJECT_ROOT)
        recent_commands = history.get_recent(1000)

        # Find patterns in development workflow
        patterns = {
            "most_used_commands": self._count_command_frequency(recent_commands),
            "error_patterns": self._analyze_errors(recent_commands),
            "command_sequences": self._find_sequences(recent_commands),
            "time_gaps": self._analyze_time_gaps(recent_commands)
        }

        return patterns

    def suggest_improvements(self) -> List[Improvement]:
        """Suggest improvements based on usage."""
        patterns = self.analyze_usage_patterns()
        suggestions = []

        # If certain commands are always used together, suggest a workflow
        for sequence in patterns["command_sequences"]:
            if sequence.frequency > 5:
                suggestions.append(Improvement(
                    type="workflow",
                    description=f"Create workflow for: {' -> '.join(sequence.commands)}",
                    impact="high",
                    implementation=self._generate_workflow_code(sequence)
                ))

        # If certain errors repeat, suggest better validation
        for error in patterns["error_patterns"]:
            if error.frequency > 3:
                suggestions.append(Improvement(
                    type="validation",
                    description=f"Add validation for: {error.pattern}",
                    impact="medium",
                    implementation=self._generate_validation_code(error)
                ))

        return suggestions
```

### Phase 2: Development Session Memory

````python
# src/khive/agent/session.py

class DevelopmentSession:
    """Track a development session for learning."""

    def __init__(self, session_id: str = None):
        self.session_id = session_id or str(uuid.uuid4())
        self.start_time = datetime.utcnow()
        self.goals = []
        self.commands_executed = []
        self.errors_encountered = []
        self.solutions_found = []

    def set_goal(self, goal: str) -> None:
        """Set the current development goal."""
        self.goals.append({
            "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
            "goal": goal
        })

    def record_solution(self, problem: str, solution: str) -> None:
        """Record a problem-solution pair."""
        self.solutions_found.append({
            "problem": problem,
            "solution": solution,
            "commands_used": self._get_recent_commands(5)
        })

    def generate_summary(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Generate a summary of the session."""
        return {
            "session_id": self.session_id,
            "duration_minutes": (datetime.utcnow() - self.start_time).seconds / 60,
            "goals_achieved": len(self.goals),
            "commands_executed": len(self.commands_executed),
            "errors_encountered": len(self.errors_encountered),
            "solutions_found": self.solutions_found,
            "productivity_score": self._calculate_productivity()
        }

    def export_learnings(self) -> str:
        """Export learnings as a prompt enhancement."""
        learnings = []

        for solution in self.solutions_found:
            learning = f"""
## Problem: {solution['problem']}
Solution: {solution['solution']}
Commands used:
```bash
{chr(10).join(solution['commands_used'])}
````

""" learnings.append(learning)

    return "\n".join(learnings)

````
### Phase 3: Continuous Learning Pipeline

```python
# src/khive/agent/learning_pipeline.py

class LearningPipeline:
    """Continuous learning from development sessions."""

    def __init__(self):
        self.knowledge_base = self._load_knowledge_base()

    def ingest_session(self, session: DevelopmentSession) -> None:
        """Ingest learnings from a development session."""
        summary = session.generate_summary()

        # Update command patterns
        self._update_command_patterns(session.commands_executed)

        # Update error solutions
        self._update_error_solutions(session.solutions_found)

        # Generate new documentation
        if summary["solutions_found"]:
            self._generate_troubleshooting_docs(session.solutions_found)

    def suggest_prompt_improvements(self) -> List[str]:
        """Suggest improvements to AI agent prompts."""
        suggestions = []

        # Based on common errors
        common_errors = self._get_common_errors()
        for error in common_errors:
            suggestions.append(
                f"Add to prompt: When encountering '{error.pattern}', "
                f"try '{error.most_successful_solution}'"
            )

        # Based on efficient workflows
        efficient_workflows = self._get_efficient_workflows()
        for workflow in efficient_workflows:
            suggestions.append(
                f"Add workflow to prompt: {workflow.name}\n"
                f"Commands: {' -> '.join(workflow.commands)}"
            )

        return suggestions
````

## Integration with Development Workflow

### 1. Start of Session

```bash
# AI agent starts a new development session
khive --agent-mode session start --goal "Design AI-first CLI features"
```

### 2. During Development

```bash
# Use khive info to research
khive info search --provider perplexity --query "..."

# Record insights
khive --agent-mode session record-insight "Discovered that schema-first design..."

# When hitting an error
khive --agent-mode session record-error "MCP connection failed"

# When finding a solution
khive --agent-mode session record-solution \
  --problem "MCP connection failed" \
  --solution "Need to mock ClientSession in tests"
```

### 3. End of Session

```bash
# Generate session summary
khive --agent-mode session end --export-learnings

# Update prompts with learnings
khive --agent-mode prompts update --from-session latest
```

## Self-Improvement Commands

### `khive improve`

Analyze usage and suggest improvements:

```bash
khive improve suggest
# Output:
# Based on your usage patterns, I suggest:
# 1. Create workflow 'test-and-commit' for: ci -> commit -> pr
# 2. Add validation for: --title parameter in PR command
# 3. Cache results for: info search (same queries repeated 5 times)
```

### `khive learn`

Learn from current session:

```bash
khive learn from-session
# Analyzes current session and updates knowledge base

khive learn export-prompts
# Exports learnings as prompt enhancements
```

### `khive meta`

Meta-analysis of the tool itself:

```bash
khive meta analyze
# Shows how khive is being used to develop khive

khive meta efficiency
# Shows time saved by using khive features

khive meta missing-features
# Detects what features would help based on usage
```

## Prompt Enhancement Template

Based on our meta-learning, add this to AI agent prompts:

```markdown
## Khive Self-Improvement Patterns

When developing khive itself, use these proven patterns:

### Research First

Always start with: `khive info search` to find best practices

### Test Incrementally

After each change: `khive ci` to ensure nothing breaks

### Document Discoveries

Use: `khive session record-insight` to capture learnings

### Common Solutions

- Mock imports for test isolation: `@patch('khive.adapters.module')`
- Structured errors for agents: Return dict with 'error' key
- Context persistence: Use `.khive/` directory for state files

### Efficient Workflows

1. Research -> Design -> Implement -> Test -> Document
2. For debugging: `khive meta analyze` -> identify pattern -> fix
3. For new features: `khive discover` existing -> extend pattern
```

## The Vision: Self-Evolving Tool

Ultimately, khive should be able to:

1. **Observe** how it's being used
2. **Learn** from successful patterns
3. **Suggest** improvements to itself
4. **Generate** code for those improvements
5. **Test** the improvements
6. **Deploy** them automatically

This creates a tool that gets better at helping AI agents the more AI agents use
it - a true positive feedback loop.

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Implement basic session tracking (`khive session`)
2. Add usage analytics (`khive meta analyze`)
3. Create learning export (`khive learn export-prompts`)
4. Update AI agent prompts with discovered patterns
5. Use the improved prompts to develop the next features

By following this meta-design approach, we ensure that every improvement to
khive immediately benefits the development of future improvements, creating an
exponential growth in capability.
