nothing more, nothing less\"\n\n### 4. **TECHNICAL DEBT CLEANUP**\n- **Remove**: 14 security test files that create unnecessary maintenance burden\n- **Simplify**: Over-engineered security abstractions and fixtures\n- **Focus**: Simple, direct Pydantic validation test patterns\n\n### 5. **QUALITY GATE RESET**\n- **Re-evaluate**: Work against original issue acceptance criteria only\n- **Verify**: All requested models have proper validation tests\n- **Confirm**: No security testing scope creep remains\n- **Test**: Run validation tests to ensure they work correctly\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**: Orchestration lost track of core requirements, allowing 10x+ scope expansion with security penetration testing instead of simple Pydantic validation.\n", "needs_redo": true}, "embedding": null}
