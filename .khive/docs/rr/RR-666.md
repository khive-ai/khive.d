# Guidance

**Purpose**\
Document synthesized insights from khive info service to guide design decisions.

**Service Integration**

- Use `khive info` for all research queries
- Service provides synthesis and citations automatically
- Focus on interpreting insights for your project

**Best Practices**

- Let khive info handle search complexity
- Add project-specific interpretation
- Include service confidence scores

# Research Report: [Topic]

## Executive Summary

_2-3 paragraph synthesis of key findings from khive info, emphasizing actionable
insights for the project._

## 1. Research Context

### 1.1 Research Questions

_What specific questions did you ask khive info?_

### 1.2 Service Queries Used

```bash
# Document your khive info queries for reproducibility
khive info "Compare OAuth token storage methods for CLI tools"
khive info "Security implications of file-based token storage"
```

## 2. Synthesized Insights

### 2.1 Key Findings from khive info

| Query Topic   | Key Insight                              | Confidence  | Impact on Project                     |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Token Storage | 80% of CLI tools use file-based approach | High (0.9)  | Validates our planned approach        |
| Security      | Atomic writes prevent corruption         | High (0.85) | Must implement proper file operations |

### 2.2 Service-Generated Recommendations

_khive info provided these recommendations:_

- Recommendation 1 (confidence: X)
- Recommendation 2 (confidence: Y)

### 2.3 Follow-up Insights

_Based on khive info's suggestions, additional queries revealed:_

- Additional insight 1
- Additional insight 2

## 3. Comparative Analysis

_khive info synthesis comparing options:_

| Factor          | Option A           | Option B       | Service Assessment                                    |
| --------------- | ------------------ | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Security        | File + permissions | System keyring | khive info: "File approach sufficient for most cases" |
| Complexity      | Low                | High           | khive info: "Keyring adds 3x complexity"              |
| User Experience | Good               | Variable       | khive info: "Users prefer predictable file locations" |

## 4. Implementation Patterns

### 4.1 Service-Validated Patterns

```python
# Pattern validated by khive info as industry standard
class TokenStorage:
    """khive info confirmed this pattern used by GitHub CLI"""
    def save_atomic(self, token: str) -> None:
        # Atomic write pattern from khive info research
        pass
```

### 4.2 Anti-Patterns Identified

_khive info warned against:_

- Anti-pattern 1: Direct file writes without atomicity
- Anti-pattern 2: Storing tokens in environment variables

## 5. Project-Specific Recommendations

### 5.1 Recommended Approach

_Based on khive info synthesis and our constraints:_

### 5.2 Risk Mitigation

_khive info identified these risks:_

- Risk 1: Mitigation strategy
- Risk 2: Mitigation strategy

## 6. Evidence Trail

### 6.1 Service Citations

_All citations provided automatically by khive info_

### 6.2 Confidence Metrics

- Overall research confidence: X%
- Number of khive info queries: Y
- Synthesis quality score: Z

## Appendices
