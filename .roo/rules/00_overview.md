## 1. Response Format

> **Every response must begin with a structured reasoning format**

```
To increase our reasoning context, Let us think through with 5 random perspectives in random order:
[^...] Reason / Action / Reflection / Expected Outcome

### 1.1 Best Practices

- always starts with reading dev_style
- check which local branch you are working at and which one you should be
  working on
- use command line to manipulate local working branch
- must clear commit tree before calling completion
- if already working on a PR or issue, you can commit to the same branch if
  appropriate, or you can add a patch branch to that particular branch. You need
  to merge the patch branch to the "feature" branch before merging to the main
  branch.
- when using command line, pay attention to the directory you are in, for
  example if you have already done

  ```
  cd frontend
  npm install
  ```

  and now you want to build the frontend, the correct command is
  `npm run build`, and the wrong answer is `cd frontend && npm run build`.
- since you are in a vscode environment, you should always use local env to make
  changes to repo. use local cli when making changes to current working
  directory
- always checkout the branch to read files locally if you can, since sometimes
  Github MCP tool gives base64 response.
- must clear commit trees among handoffs.

- **Search first, code second.**
- Follow Conventional Commits.
- Run `khive ci` locally before pushing.
- Keep templates up to date; replace all `{{PLACEHOLDER:â€¦}}`.
- Security, performance, and readability are non-negotiable.
- Be kind - leave code better than you found it. ðŸš€

### 1.. Citation

- All information from external searches must be properly cited
- Use `...` format for citations
- Cite specific claims rather than general knowledge
- Provide sufficient context around citations
- Never reproduce copyrighted content in entirety, Limit direct quotes to less
  than 25 words
- Do not reproduce song lyrics under any circumstances
- Summarize content in own words when possible

### 1.3 Thinking Methodologies

  unconventional solutions beyond traditional boundaries.

- **Critical Thinking** [^Critical]: Analyze problems from multiple
  perspectives, question assumptions, and evaluate evidence using logical
  reasoning.

- **Systems Thinking** [^System]: Consider problems as part of larger systems,
  identifying underlying causes, feedback loops, and interdependencies.

- **Reflective Thinking** [^Reflect]: Step back to examine personal biases,
  assumptions, and mental models, learning from past experiences.

- **Risk Analysis** [^Risk]: Evaluate potential risks, uncertainties, and
  trade-offs associated with different solutions.

- **Stakeholder Analysis** [^Stakeholder]: Consider human behavior aspects,
  affected individuals, perspectives, needs, and required resources.

## 2. Core Principles

1. **Autonomy & Specialisation** - each agent sticks to its stage of the golden
   path.
2. **Search-Driven Development (MANDATORY)** - run `khive search` **before**
   design/impl _Cite result IDs / links in specs, plans, PRs, commits._
3. **TDD & Quality** - >80 pct combined coverage (`khive ci --threshold 80` in
   CI).
4. **Clear Interfaces** - `shared-protocol` defines Rust â†” TS contracts; Tauri
   commands/events are the API.
5. **GitHub Orchestration** - Issues & PRs are the single source of truth.
6. **Use local read/edit** - use native roo tools for reading and editing files
7. **Local CLI First** - prefer plain `git`, `gh`, `pnpm`, `cargo`, plus helper
   scripts (`khive-*`).
8. **Standardised Templates** - Create via CLI (`khive new-doc`) and should be
   **filled** and put under `reports/...`
9. **Quality Gates** - CI + reviewer approval before merge.
10. **Know your issue** - always check the issue you are working on, use github
    intelligently, correct others mistakes and get everyone on the same page.

| code | template         | description           | folder         |
| ---- | ---------------- | --------------------- | -------------- |
| RR   | `RR-<issue>.md`  | Research Report       | `reports/rr/`  |
| TDS  | `TDS-<issue>.md` | Technical Design Spec | `reports/tds/` |
| IP   | `IP-<issue>.md`  | Implementation Plan   | `reports/ip/`  |
| TI   | `TI-<issue>.md`  | Test Implementation   | `reports/ti/`  |
| CRR  | `CRR-<pr>.md`    | Code Review Report    | `reports/crr/` |

if it's an issue needing zero or one pr, don't need to add suffix

**Example**

> khive new-doc RR 123 # RR = Research Report, this ->
> docs/reports/research/RR-123.md

if you are doing multiple pr's for the same issue, you need to add suffix

> _issue 150_ khive new-doc ID 150-pr1 # ID = Implementation plans, this ->
> docs/reports/plans/ID-150-pr1.md

> khive new-doc TDS 150-pr2

11. **Docs Mirror Reality** - update docs **after** Quality Review passes.

## 3. Golden Path & Roles

| Stage          | Role                     | Primary Artifacts (template)                 | Search citation |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Research       | `khive-researcher`       | `RR-<issue>.md`                              | âœ…              |
| Design         | `khive-architect`        | `TDS-<issue>.md`                             | âœ…              |
| Implement      | `khive-implementer`      | `IP-<issue>.md`, `TI-<issue>.md`, code+tests | âœ…              |
| Quality Review | `khive-quality-reviewer` | `CRR-<pr>.md` (optional) + GH review         | verifies        |
| Document       | `khive-documenter`       | Updated READMEs / guides                     | N/A             |

Each artifact must be committed before hand-off to the next stage.

### 3.1 Team Roles

researcher Â· architect Â· implementer Â· quality-reviewer Â· documenter Â·
orchestrator

### 3.2 Golden Path

1. Research â†’ 2. Design â†’ 3. Implement â†’ 4. Quality-Review â†’ 5. Document â†’ Merge

## 4. Tooling Matrix

## Core Philosophy

- **Single entry-point** â†’ `khive <command>`
- **Convention over config** â†’ sensible defaults, TOML for the rest
- **CI/local parity** â†’ the CLI and the GH workflow run the _same_ code
- **Idempotent helpers** â†’ safe to run repeatedly; exit 0 on "nothing to do"
- **No lock-in** â†’ wraps existing ecosystem tools instead of reinventing them

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1 Â· clone & install
$ git clone https://github.com/khive-dev/khive.git
$ cd khive
$ uv pip install -e .        # editable install - puts `khive` on your PATH

# 2 Â· bootstrap repo (node deps, rust fmt, git hooks, â€¦)
$ khive init -v

# 3 Â· hack happily
$ khive fmt --check           # smoke-test formatting
$ khive ci --check            # quick pre-commit gate
```

## Command Catalogue

| Command         | What it does (TL;DR)                                                                       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `khive init`    | Verifies toolchain, installs JS & Python deps, runs `cargo check`, wires Husky hooks.      |
| `khive fmt`     | Opinionated multi-stack formatter (`ruff` + `black`, `cargo fmt`, `deno fmt`, `markdown`). |
| `khive commit`  | Stages â†’ (optional patch-select) â†’ conventional commit â†’ (optional) push.                  |
| `khive pr`      | Pushes branch & opens/creates GitHub PR (uses `gh`).                                       |
| `khive ci`      | Local CI gate - lints, tests, coverage, template checks. Mirrors GH Actions.               |
| `khive clean`   | Deletes a finished branch locally & remotely - never nukes default branch.                 |
| `khive new-doc` | Scaffolds markdown docs (ADR, RFC, IPâ€¦) from templates with front-matter placeholders.     |
| `khive reader`  | Opens/reads arbitrary docs via `docling`; returns JSON over stdout.                        |
| `khive search`  | Validates & (optionally) executes Exa/Perplexity searches.                                 |

Run `khive <command> --help` for full flag reference.

## Usage Examples

```bash
# format *everything*, fixing files in-place
khive fmt

# format only Rust & docs, check-only
khive fmt --stack rust,docs --check

# staged patch commit, no push (good for WIP)
khive commit "feat(ui): dark-mode toggle" --patch --no-push

# open PR in browser as draft
khive pr --draft --web

# run the same CI suite GH will run
khive ci
