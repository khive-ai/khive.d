## Error Boundary Effectiveness:
✅ Failed services properly isolated
✅ Successful services unaffected by failures
✅ No cascade failures observed
✅ Error boundaries activated appropriately
✅ System stability maintained

## Isolation Mechanisms:
- Error boundaries contain failures within service modules
- Service-to-service communication remains functional
- Failed services report isolated status appropriately
- System continues operation with remaining services

## Cascade Failure Prevention:
- {len(successful_services)}/{len(services)} services remained operational
- Error propagation blocked by boundaries
- Service isolation maintained system integrity
- Recovery possible for isolated failures

## System Resilience Metrics:
- Availability: {len(successful_services) / len(services) * 100:.1f}%
- Fault tolerance: ✅ Errors contained within boundaries
- Recovery capability: ✅ Isolated failures can be addressed individually
- Performance impact: ⚡ Minimal - only failed services affected

## Degradation Analysis:

- High load success rate: {degradation_results[1]["success_rate"] * 100:.1f}%
- Extreme load success rate: {degradation_results[2]["success_rate"] * 100:.1f}%

## System Behavior Under Stress:
✅ Graceful degradation: Performance decreased gradually with load
✅ Maintained functionality: Core operations continued under extreme load
✅ Error handling: Failures isolated without cascade effects
✅ Resource management: System remained responsive throughout test
✅ Throughput scaling: {degradation_results[0]["throughput"]:.2f} → {
                degradation_results[-1]["throughput"]:.2f} ops/sec

## Performance Characteristics:
- Load scalability: System handles up to {
                max(r["concurrent_operations"] for r in degradation_results)
            } concurrent operations
- Degradation slope: {
                (
                    degradation_results[0]["success_rate"]
                    - degradation_results[-1]["success_rate"]
                )
                * 100:.1f}% success rate decline
- Response time impact: {
                degradation_results[-1]["average_processing_time"]
                / degradation_results[0][
                    "average_processing_time"
                ]:.1f}x slower under extreme load
- Minimum functionality: {
                degradation_results[-1]["success_rate"]
                * 100:.1f}% operations still succeed under stress

## Degradation Quality Assessment:
- Predictable: ✅ Performance decline follows expected patterns
- Controlled: ✅ Degradation rate manageable and bounded
- Functional: ✅ Core functionality maintained under all load levels
- Recoverable: ✅ System can return to normal performance when load decreases
