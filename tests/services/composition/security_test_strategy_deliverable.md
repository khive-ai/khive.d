# AgentComposer Security Test Strategy Analysis

## Executive Summary

This analysis provides comprehensive security test suite design for the
AgentComposer class, focusing on validation paths, attack prevention, input
sanitization, and edge case handling. The testing strategy addresses critical
security vulnerabilities while ensuring >95% code coverage requirements for
Issue #185.

## Current Security Coverage Assessment

### Existing Protections ✅

- **Path Traversal Prevention**: `_is_safe_path()` validates file paths against
  directory traversal
- **Input Sanitization**: `_sanitize_input()` removes dangerous characters and
  patterns
- **Context Sanitization**: `_sanitize_context()` filters prompt injection
  attempts with [FILTERED] markers
- **File Size Limits**: 10MB limit enforced at both file stat and content level
- **YAML Safety**: Uses `yaml.safe_load()` to prevent deserialization attacks
- **Cache Key Security**: `_sanitize_cache_key()` prevents cache poisoning
- **Thread Safety**: File operations use `threading.Lock()` for concurrent
  access

### Identified Security Gaps ⚠️

1. **Incomplete Prompt Injection Detection**: Some nested and obfuscated
   patterns bypass filtering
2. **Unicode Normalization Issues**: Directional override characters not fully
   handled
3. **Context Boundary Violations**: Some boundary escape attempts not detected
4. **Resource Exhaustion Edge Cases**: Deep YAML recursion scenarios need more
   coverage
5. **Encoding Attack Vectors**: Limited testing of various encoding bypass
   attempts

## Comprehensive Test Suite Design

### 1. Malformed File Handling Tests

**Critical Test Categories:**

- **YAML Syntax Errors**: Unclosed quotes, brackets, invalid indentation, mixed
  tabs/spaces
- **Corrupted Files**: Binary masquerading as YAML, null bytes, empty files, BOM
  corruption
- **Encoding Issues**: Latin-1, CP1252, UTF-16/32, invalid UTF-8 sequences
- **Parser Stress**: Circular references, infinite recursion, extremely nested
  structures

**Implementation Strategy:**

```python
# Example edge case coverage
malformed_yamls = [
    'key: "unclosed string',           # Unclosed quote
    'anchor: &ref\n  child: *ref',     # Circular reference
    'key:\n' + '  ' * 1000 + 'value', # Extreme nesting
    'key: value\x00null\xff',         # Binary content
]
```

**Expected Behavior:** All malformed files should return empty dict `{}` without
crashing or executing code.

### 2. Advanced Injection Attack Prevention

**Multi-Vector Attack Categories:**

#### Path Traversal Attacks (46+ test vectors)

- Basic: `../../../etc/passwd`, `..\\..\\..\\windows\\system32`
- Encoded: `%2e%2e%2f`, `\u002e\u002e\u002f`, double-encoded variations
- Mixed separators: `role\\/..\\/..\\/etc`
- Command injection: `role; rm -rf /`, `role$(malicious)`
- Unicode attacks: Directional overrides, lookalike characters

#### Prompt Injection Attacks (53+ test vectors)

- **Basic Override**: "ignore previous instructions", "forget everything"
- **Context Boundary**: Breaking out with fake conversation markers
- **Template Injection**: `{{system_override}}`, `<system>malicious</system>`
- **Role Confusion**: Impersonating system/user/assistant roles
- **Encoding Obfuscation**: Base64, ROT13, Unicode escapes, HTML entities
- **Multilingual**: Spanish, French, Japanese, Russian, Chinese variations

#### Command Injection Patterns (25+ test vectors)

- Command separators: `;`, `&&`, `||`, `|`, `&`
- Command substitution: backticks, `$()`, `${}`
- Environment manipulation: `$IFS`, `${PATH}`
- Shell expansion: `*`, `?`, `[]`, `{}`

**Testing Implementation:**

```python
def test_comprehensive_injection_prevention():
    for attack_vector in ALL_INJECTION_VECTORS:
        sanitized = composer._sanitize_context(attack_vector)
        # Verify dangerous patterns filtered or sanitized
        assert_dangerous_patterns_filtered(sanitized, attack_vector)
```

### 3. Resource Exhaustion & Edge Cases

**File Size Boundary Testing:**

- Exactly 10MB (should pass)
- 10MB + 1 byte (should reject)
- Massive files (1GB+)
- Reported vs actual size mismatches

**Memory Exhaustion Scenarios:**

- 5MB single-line values
- 100,000+ small keys (fragmentation)
- Deep nesting (1000+ levels)
- Wide nesting (10,000+ keys per level)
- Complex anchors and references

**Performance Requirements:**

- All operations complete within 10 seconds
- Memory usage stays under reasonable limits
- No infinite loops or hangs

### 4. Concurrent Security Testing

**Thread Safety Validation:**

- 50+ concurrent file operations
- Race conditions in sanitization functions
- Cache key generation collisions
- Agent ID uniqueness under concurrency

**Stress Test Scenarios:**

- **High Concurrency**: 50 threads, 100 operations each
- **Burst Load**: 20 threads, 500 operations rapid-fire
- **Sustained Load**: 10 threads, 1000 operations sustained
- **Race Conditions**: 8 threads targeting same resources

**Success Criteria:**

- No data corruption or security bypasses
- All operations complete within timeout
- Thread-safe access to shared resources

### 5. Security Regression Test Suite

**Known Vulnerability Coverage:**

- **PATH-TRAVERSAL-001**: Basic directory traversal prevention
- **CMD-INJECTION-001**: Command injection in input sanitization
- **PROMPT-INJECTION-001**: System override detection and filtering
- **YAML-RCE-001**: YAML deserialization safety
- **CACHE-POISON-001**: Cache key injection prevention
- **UNICODE-BYPASS-001**: Unicode normalization attacks
- **SIZE-BYPASS-001**: File size limit enforcement
- **SYMLINK-TRAVERSAL-001**: Symlink resolution blocking

**Automated Regression Testing:**

```python
def test_security_regression_suite():
    for vulnerability in KNOWN_VULNERABILITIES:
        result = test_vulnerability(vulnerability)
        assert result.matches_expected_behavior()
        log_regression_test_result(vulnerability.id, result)
```

## Strategic Implementation Recommendations
