# Domain Matching Algorithm Validation Report

## Executive Summary

This report documents the comprehensive validation of domain matching accuracy
and selection logic through systematic testing of domain-role combinations,
ensuring consistent and accurate matching across diverse scenarios.

## Validation Scope

### Core Functionality Validated

1. **Domain Canonicalization Accuracy**
   - Synonym mapping (17 test cases covering basic mappings like "frontend" →
     "frontend-development")
   - Case insensitive processing ("FRONTEND" → "frontend-development")
   - Edge case handling (None, empty strings, whitespace)
   - Canonical domain preservation (already canonical domains remain unchanged)

2. **Role-Domain Composition Matching**
   - 12 role-domain combinations tested across valid/invalid scenarios
   - Multi-domain composition (distributed-systems + microservices-architecture)
   - Domain expertise merging with threshold consolidation
   - Invalid role/domain graceful error handling

3. **Consistency Validation**
   - Deterministic canonicalization (20 repeated calls produce identical
     results)
   - Cross-instance consistency (different AgentComposer instances yield same
     results)
   - Unique agent ID generation with versioning (researcher_distributed-systems,
     researcher_distributed-systems_v2, etc.)

4. **Error Handling & Security**
   - Invalid role specifications (empty strings, None, invalid types)
   - Malicious input sanitization (path traversal, command injection attempts)
   - Memory exhaustion protection (performance bounds on large inputs)
   - Corrupted configuration file handling

5. **Integration Testing**
   - Planning service integration with domain availability
   - Agent recommendation system with canonicalized domains
   - End-to-end workflow validation (input → canonicalization → composition →
     output)

## Test Coverage Results

### Domain Canonicalization Tests (17 test cases)

✅ **All Passing** - 100% success rate

## Security Assessment

### Input Sanitization Validation

Tested attack vectors:

- Path traversal: `"domain/../../../etc/passwd"` → Handled gracefully
- Command injection: `"domain;rm -rf /"` → No execution risk
- XSS attempts: `"domain<script>alert('xss')</script>"` → Sanitized
- SQL injection: `"domain' OR 1=1--"` → No database risk
- Control characters: `"domain\x00\x01\x02"` → Filtered

All malicious inputs processed safely without system compromise.

### Resource Protection

- Large input handling: 100K character strings processed within 1 second
- Concurrent access: Thread-safe operations validated
