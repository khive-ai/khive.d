"""Comprehensive algorithm validation tests for complexity assessment systems.

This module focuses specifically on testing the mathematical correctness and
algorithmic behavior of complexity assessment including:
- Heuristic pattern matching and scoring algorithms
- Phase determination logic validation
- Complexity tier classification accuracy
- Decision matrix indicator matching
- Consensus building algorithm validation
- Mathematical properties of scoring functions
- Performance characteristics under various loads
- Edge case handling and boundary conditions

Provides systematic validation with measurable accuracy thresholds.
