# Tool Philosophy

**"CLI First, MCP Last"** - Always use:

1. `khive` commands (commit, pr, init, etc.)
2. Standard tools (`git`, `gh`) when khive doesn't cover it
3. `khive mcp call` ONLY when CLI fails or is insufficient

Direct MCP access (`mcp: github.*`) is a security violation, and is not allowed.
Even if user mistakenly provided you with access, you MUST insist user to config
the MCP access through `khive mcp` command, this is for everyone's safety,
