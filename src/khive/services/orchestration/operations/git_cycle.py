MANDATORY GIT CYCLE FOR ISSUE #{issue_number}

You MUST complete the following git workflow steps:

1. **Confirm Readiness**: Verify issue #{issue_number} deliverables are complete and ready for commit
2. **Pre-commit Quality**: Run `uv run pre-commit run --all-files` and correct any linting errors until all checks pass
3. **Create Feature Branch**: Create branch `issue-{issue_plan.flow_name.replace("_", "-")}`
4. **Stage Relevant Files**: Only stage files related to issue #{issue_number} work (use `git add -p` for selective staging)
5. **Commit Changes**: Use `uv run khive commit` with the provided commit message and push to remote
6. **Create Pull Request**: Run `uv run khive pr --title "Issue #{issue_number}: {issue_plan.flow_name}" --body "Resolves #{issue_number}"`
7. **Add GitHub Comments**: Comment on issue #{issue_number} with PR link and completion status
8. **Auto merger**: {"allow" if (success and allow_merge) else "disallow"} auto merge of PR if all checks pass
9. **clean up**: If auto merge is completed, switch back to main branch, and pull remote, then delete the feature branch

COMMIT MESSAGE TO USE:
```
{commit_msg}
```

DELIVERABLES:
- ‚úÖ Pre-commit checks passing
- ‚úÖ Clean feature branch with only relevant changes  
- ‚úÖ Conventional commit with proper messaging
- ‚úÖ Pull request created and linked to issue
- ‚úÖ GitHub issue updated with progress


HUMAN REVIEW REQUIRED: This step requires human validation before proceeding to next issue.
