# Session Persistence, Recovery & Error Propagation Integration Tests

## Overview

This implementation addresses GitHub issue #191 by creating comprehensive integration tests for session persistence, recovery mechanisms, and error propagation scenarios that complement the existing `test_complete_workflows.py` coverage.

## Test Suite Components

### 1. Session Persistence & Recovery Tests (`test_session_persistence_recovery.py`)

**Focus**: Session state persistence across interruptions and system recovery

**Key Test Scenarios**:
- **Session Interruption Recovery**: Validates session state preservation across simulated system interruptions
- **Error Boundary Isolation**: Tests error propagation control and boundary isolation mechanisms  
- **Persistence Layer Reliability**: Comprehensive testing of filesystem persistence under concurrent operations
- **Redis Cache Failure Recovery**: Validates system behavior when cache layer fails
- **Session Initialization & Resume**: Tests session resume functionality with real file structures

**Complementary Coverage**: Fills gaps in session lifecycle testing not covered by existing workflow tests.

### 2. Async Error Coordination Tests (`test_async_error_coordination.py`)

**Focus**: Async-specific error handling and multi-agent coordination failures

**Key Test Scenarios**:
- **Async Timeout Propagation**: Tests timeout handling across coordinated async operations
- **Coordination Failure Scenarios**: Validates multi-agent coordination with dependency failures
- **Resource Exhaustion & Backpressure**: Tests system behavior under resource constraints

**Complementary Coverage**: Extends existing async workflow tests with specific focus on failure scenarios and recovery patterns.

### 3. Performance & Load Tests (`test_performance_load_scenarios.py`)

**Focus**: System behavior under load and performance characteristics validation

**Key Test Scenarios**:
- **High Volume Document Operations**: Progressive load testing (50/100/200 operations)
- **Concurrent Session Operations**: Multi-session concurrent workload testing
- **Sustained Load Endurance**: Long-duration performance stability validation

**Complementary Coverage**: Provides performance baseline and scalability validation not present in existing tests.

## Technical Implementation Highlights

### Advanced Error Injection
- **Controlled Failure Patterns**: Systematic error injection with configurable failure rates
- **Realistic Error Scenarios**: Timeout, connection, resource exhaustion, and cancellation errors
- **Recovery Validation**: Comprehensive testing of recovery mechanisms and fallback behavior

### Async Programming Patterns
- **Proper Async Context Management**: Correct use of `asyncio.gather()`, `asyncio.wait_for()`, and semaphores
- **Resource Management**: Backpressure handling with semaphore-based resource limiting
- **Error Boundary Implementation**: Isolation of errors to prevent cascading failures

### Performance Profiling
- **Comprehensive Metrics Collection**: Duration, memory usage, throughput, and concurrency measurements
- **Progressive Load Testing**: Systematic testing across multiple load levels
- **Endurance Validation**: Long-running tests to detect performance degradation over time

### Realistic Test Scenarios
- **Multi-Session Isolation**: Validates session independence under concurrent load
- **Dependency Graph Testing**: Complex coordination patterns with failure scenarios
- **System Recovery**: Comprehensive testing of recovery after various failure types

## Integration with Existing Infrastructure

### Reuses Existing Patterns
- **Fixtures**: Leverages existing `artifacts_service`, `temp_workspace`, and `test_author` fixtures
- **Service Architecture**: Uses established `ArtifactsService` and `SessionManager` patterns
- **Mock Strategies**: Extends existing mock patterns for external services

### Complements Existing Coverage
- **Workflow Tests**: Existing tests focus on successful workflows; new tests focus on failure scenarios
- **Basic Session Tests**: Existing tests cover basic CRUD operations; new tests focus on persistence and recovery
- **Performance Gap**: Adds missing performance and load testing coverage

## Validation & Quality Assurance

### Test Quality Measures
- **Comprehensive Assertions**: Each test includes multiple validation points
- **Error Scenario Coverage**: Tests both expected and edge-case error conditions
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Establishes baseline performance expectations
- **Documentation**: Each test includes detailed analysis reports

### CI/CD Compatibility
- **Reasonable Test Duration**: Tests complete in reasonable time for CI environments
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup and resource management for CI systems
- **Mock Strategy**: Uses mocks for external dependencies to ensure test reliability

## Key Benefits

### 1. **Robustness Validation**
- Confirms system stability under failure conditions
- Validates recovery mechanisms work as designed
- Tests error isolation and boundary enforcement

### 2. **Performance Baseline**
- Establishes performance benchmarks for regression testing
- Validates scalability characteristics
- Tests system behavior under load

### 3. **Operational Confidence**
- Provides comprehensive testing of real-world failure scenarios
- Validates session persistence across system interruptions
- Tests recovery procedures and fallback mechanisms

## Future Extensibility

The test architecture is designed for easy extension:
- **Modular Error Injection**: Easy to add new error types and patterns
- **Configurable Load Patterns**: Simple to adjust load levels and patterns
- **Plugin Architecture**: Easy to add new performance metrics and validation

## Usage Guidelines

### Running Individual Test Suites
```bash
# Session persistence and recovery tests
pytest tests/integration/test_session_persistence_recovery.py -v

# Async error coordination tests  
pytest tests/integration/test_async_error_coordination.py -v

# Performance and load tests
pytest tests/integration/test_performance_load_scenarios.py -v
```

### Performance Testing Considerations
- Performance tests may take longer to complete
- Memory usage tests require sufficient system resources
- Load tests create temporary high filesystem activity

### Error Testing Notes
- Error injection is controlled and predictable
- Recovery mechanisms are thoroughly validated
- All error scenarios include proper cleanup

## Conclusion

This comprehensive integration test suite fills critical gaps in the existing test coverage by focusing specifically on:

1. **Session persistence and recovery** - areas not fully covered by existing workflow tests
2. **Error propagation and boundary isolation** - critical for system reliability
3. **Performance and scalability characteristics** - essential for production readiness

The implementation follows established patterns, reuses existing infrastructure, and provides thorough validation of system resilience under various failure and load conditions.
