# Enhanced Command Palette - Feature Specification

## Ocean's Ultimate CLI-Like Interface for KHIVE Control

The Command Palette has been completely enhanced with advanced features making it Ocean's superpower for controlling his entire KHIVE ecosystem with <50ms search response time and comprehensive keyboard-only operation.

## 🚀 Core Enhancements

### 1. Enhanced Contextual Suggestions
- **Workspace Context Detection**: Automatically detects current workspace state (active agents, files, errors)
- **Smart Context Boosting**: Commands relevant to current context receive higher priority scores
- **Context Information Bar**: Visual indicator showing current view, active agents, and error states
- **View-Aware Suggestions**: Different command sets based on whether you're in agents, planning, analytics, or monitoring view

### 2. Frequency-Based Command Ranking
- **Usage Frequency Tracking**: Commands used more frequently appear higher in search results
- **Frequency Score Display**: Visual indicators showing how often commands are used (e.g., "5x")
- **Smart History Management**: Last 100 commands stored with execution times and success rates
- **Adaptive Learning**: System learns Ocean's command patterns and prioritizes accordingly

### 3. Advanced Command Composition & Chaining
- **Command Chain Builder**: Visual interface for creating command sequences
- **Shift+Enter Chaining**: Add commands to chain using Shift+Enter instead of executing immediately
- **Chain Execution**: Execute entire command chains with staggered timing (100ms intervals)
- **Chain Persistence**: Save command chains as reusable macros
- **Visual Chain Management**: See all chained commands with individual removal capability

### 4. Natural Language Command Parsing
- **Semantic Understanding**: Parse natural language queries like "plan a frontend task" → o:plan
- **Intent Detection**: AI-powered matching of user intent to specific commands
- **Confidence Scoring**: Visual indicators when AI matches commands to queries
- **Mode Toggle**: Switch between command mode and natural language mode
- **Pattern Recognition**: Learns from natural language patterns for better matching

### 5. Command Templates & Macros
- **Pre-built Templates**: Ready-to-use workflow templates (Research, System Health, Agent Pipeline)
- **Variable Substitution**: Templates support variables like ${topic}, ${domain}, ${role}
- **Template Execution**: Run multi-command workflows with single invocation
- **Custom Macros**: Create reusable command sequences from chains
- **Macro Management**: Store, execute, and manage personal command macros
- **Usage Tracking**: Templates and macros track usage frequency

### 6. Comprehensive Tab System
- **All Commands**: Full command catalog with advanced search
- **Recent**: Recently used commands with frequency indicators
- **Favorites**: Starred commands with easy toggle
- **Context**: Commands relevant to current workspace context
- **Templates**: Pre-built workflow templates
- **Macros**: User-created command sequences

## ⚡ Performance Features

### Sub-50ms Search Response
- **Optimized Filtering**: Efficient command pool filtering and scoring
- **Lazy Loading**: Components load only when needed
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of command history
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time execution time tracking in footer

### Advanced Search & Scoring
- **Multi-dimensional Scoring**: Title, subtitle, category, ID, prefix, frequency, semantic, context, and fuzzy matching
- **Prefix Filtering**: Type `o:`, `a:`, `f:`, `s:`, `g:` for category-specific commands
- **Fuzzy Search**: Handles typos and partial matches with Levenshtein-like scoring
- **Context Boosting**: Workspace context influences command relevance

## 🎯 Advanced UI Features

### Command Chain Builder
```
[Command Chain (2/5)]
[o:plan research] [a:compose researcher] [▷ Execute] [💾 Save as Macro] [✗ Clear]
```

### Smart Command Display
- **Category Pills**: Color-coded command categories
- **Frequency Badges**: Usage count indicators
- **AI Match Icons**: Semantic matching indicators
- **Parameter Hints**: Show expected command parameters
- **Chainable Indicators**: Visual chain-link icons for chainable commands
- **Favorites**: Star/unstar commands for quick access

### Context Information Bar
```
✨ Context: planning view | 2 active agents | 1 error
```
